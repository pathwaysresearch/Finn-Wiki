Document understanding



Gemini models can process documents in PDF format, using native vision to understand entire document contexts. This goes beyond just text extraction, allowing Gemini to:

Analyze and interpret content, including text, images, diagrams, charts, and tables, even in long documents up to 1000 pages.
Extract information into structured output formats.
Summarize and answer questions based on both the visual and textual elements in a document.
Transcribe document content (e.g. to HTML), preserving layouts and formatting, for use in downstream applications.
You can also pass non-PDF documents in the same way but Gemini will see them as normal text which will eliminate context like charts or formatting.

Passing PDF data inline
You can pass PDF data inline in the request to generateContent. This is best suited for smaller documents or temporary processing where you don't need to reference the file in subsequent requests. We recommend using the Files API for larger documents that you need to refer to in multi-turn interactions to improve request latency and reduce bandwidth usage.

The following example shows you how to fetch a PDF from a URL and convert it to bytes for processing:

 

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import httpx

client = genai.Client()

doc_url = "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10089234/1/343019_3_art_0_py4t4l_convrt.pdf"

# Retrieve and encode the PDF byte
doc_data = httpx.get(doc_url).content

prompt = "Summarize this document"
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
    contents=[
        types.Part.from_bytes(
            data=doc_data,
            mime_type='application/pdf',
        ),
        prompt
    ]
)

print(response.text)
You can also read a PDF from a local file for processing:

Python

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import pathlib

client = genai.Client()

# Retrieve and encode the PDF byte
filepath = pathlib.Path('file.pdf')

prompt = "Summarize this document"
response = client.models.generate_content(
  model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents=[
      types.Part.from_bytes(
        data=filepath.read_bytes(),
        mime_type='application/pdf',
      ),
      prompt])
print(response.text)
Uploading PDFs using the Files API
We recommend you use Files API for larger files or when you intend to reuse a document across multiple requests. This improves request latency and reduces bandwidth usage by decoupling the file upload from the model requests.

Note: The Files API is available at no cost in all regions where the Gemini API is available. Uploaded files are stored for 48 hours.
Large PDFs from URLs
Use the File API to simplify uploading and processing large PDF files from URLs:

 

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import io
import httpx

client = genai.Client()

long_context_pdf_path = "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/static/history/alsj/a17/A17_FlightPlan.pdf"

# Retrieve and upload the PDF using the File API
doc_io = io.BytesIO(httpx.get(long_context_pdf_path).content)

sample_doc = client.files.upload(
  # You can pass a path or a file-like object here
  file=doc_io,
  config=dict(
    mime_type='application/pdf')
)

prompt = "Summarize this document"

response = client.models.generate_content(
  model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents=[sample_doc, prompt])
print(response.text)
Large PDFs stored locally
 

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import pathlib
import httpx

client = genai.Client()

# Retrieve and encode the PDF byte
file_path = pathlib.Path('large_file.pdf')

# Upload the PDF using the File API
sample_file = client.files.upload(
    file=file_path,
)

prompt="Summarize this document"

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
    contents=[sample_file, "Summarize this document"])
print(response.text)
You can verify the API successfully stored the uploaded file and get its metadata by calling files.get. Only the name (and by extension, the uri) are unique.

Python
REST

from google import genai
import pathlib

client = genai.Client()

fpath = pathlib.Path('example.txt')
fpath.write_text('hello')

file = client.files.upload(file='example.txt')

file_info = client.files.get(name=file.name)
print(file_info.model_dump_json(indent=4))
Passing multiple PDFs
The Gemini API is capable of processing multiple PDF documents (up to 1000 pages) in a single request, as long as the combined size of the documents and the text prompt stays within the model's context window.

 

from google import genai
import io
import httpx

client = genai.Client()

doc_url_1 = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11805"
doc_url_2 = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05530"

# Retrieve and upload both PDFs using the File API
doc_data_1 = io.BytesIO(httpx.get(doc_url_1).content)
doc_data_2 = io.BytesIO(httpx.get(doc_url_2).content)

sample_pdf_1 = client.files.upload(
  file=doc_data_1,
  config=dict(mime_type='application/pdf')
)
sample_pdf_2 = client.files.upload(
  file=doc_data_2,
  config=dict(mime_type='application/pdf')
)

prompt = "What is the difference between each of the main benchmarks between these two papers? Output these in a table."

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
    contents=[sample_pdf_1, sample_pdf_2, prompt]
)

print(response.text)
Technical details
Gemini supports PDF files up to 50MB or 1000 pages. This limit applies to both inline data and Files API uploads. Each document page is equivalent to 258 tokens.

While there are no specific limits to the number of pixels in a document besides the model's context window, larger pages are scaled down to a maximum resolution of 3072 x 3072 while preserving their original aspect ratio, while smaller pages are scaled up to 768 x 768 pixels. There is no cost reduction for pages at lower sizes, other than bandwidth, or performance improvement for pages at higher resolution.

Gemini 3 models
Gemini 3 introduces granular control over multimodal vision processing with the media_resolution parameter. You can now set the resolution to low, medium, or high per individual media part. With this addition, the processing of PDF documents has been updated:

Native text inclusion: Text natively embedded in the PDF is extracted and provided to the model.
Billing & token reporting:
You are not charged for tokens originating from the extracted native text in PDFs.
In the usage_metadata section of the API response, tokens generated from processing PDF pages (as images) are now counted under the IMAGE modality, not a separate DOCUMENT modality as in some earlier versions.
For more details about the media resolution parameter, see the Media resolution guide.

Document types
Technically, you can pass other MIME types for document understanding, like TXT, Markdown, HTML, XML, etc. However, document vision only meaningfully understands PDFs. Other types will be extracted as pure text, and the model won't be able to interpret what we see in the rendering of those files. Any file-type specifics like charts, diagrams, HTML tags, Markdown formatting, etc., will be lost.

To learn about other file input methods, see the File input methods guide.

Best practices
For best results:

Rotate pages to the correct orientation before uploading.
Avoid blurry pages.
If using a single page, place the text prompt after the page.
